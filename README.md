# Potluck

The Potluck app detects various food items using snapdragon neural network processing. It also collects the timestamp of detection and sends to the user for confirmation.

Once authorized to share, the items from multiple users are stored in a common database along with the identity of the individual.

Different individuals can now see the items that others are willing to share.
